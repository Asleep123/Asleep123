## Heya, I'm Asleep!
I love to learn about new things, whether they are technology-related or not. I aim to not just join the crowd of ordinary developers with basic moderation Discord bots. I like to come up with new and unique ideas that can empower the community.

- Languages: TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Python(ish)
- Hobbies: 3D Design, cycling, cybersec, web/Discord bot development, home labbing
- Personal Projects: temp-server-creator: A self-hosted Discord bot for managing individual sandboxed guilds for Discord developers; CarbonCraft: A block-based Discord bot builder utilizing [Buape Studios'](https://buape.com) in-house HTTP interaction library [Carbon](https://github.com/buape/carbon).
- Social Media: @imdefasleep on Discord, @asleep.01 on Signal

I work for Buape Studios (circa August 2024), a development organization constructed to produce high-quality applications and delegate the next era of developers. I work on our infrastructure and develop some of our projects, such as [Kiai](https://kiai.app), the next-generation Discord leveling bot; or [JT-99](https://jt-99.net), a cross-chat network designed to link multiple communities together.
\* *Please note that my actions do not represent Buape Studios or its subsidiaries.*

I own a home lab setup consisting of a WattBox WB-400-8 PDU, an Araknis AN-110-SW-R-16, a Raspberry Pi 4 running PiKVM, and an old Dell Optiplex 7040 with 32GB of RAM and an Intel i7-6700 running Proxmox. I host things like [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden), [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/), [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/), and a Minecraft server for my friends.
